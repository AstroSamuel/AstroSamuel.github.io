								planetary mass objects, determining the strange chemistry of their atmospheres, 
								and probing the substellar mass function. Most notablty, I had the opprotunity to

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/xTwitter1.png" alt=""/><b>Spectral Sequence of JWST Spectral Energy Distributions from <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973..107B/abstract">Beiler et. al 2024a</a></b></span>
									<p>I led the work for a 75 hour JWST Cycle 1 Program observing broad-wavelength 
									(1-21 &mu;) spectral energy distributions of 23 of the coldest brown dwarfs 
									(1000-350 K). The broad wavelength coverage of these observations allowed me to 
									account for 95% of the light emitted by these objects, resulting in precise and 
									accurate luminosity and temperature measurements. As a part of this work, I 
									published the first full SED of a Y dwarf, and identified the &nu; <sub>1</sub>
									vibrational band of ammonia for the first time <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...951L..48B/abstract"> (Beiler et al. 2023)</a>. For this paper I navigated the growing 
									pains of the official JWST reduction pipeline, including a correction to the MIRI LRS 
									wavelength calibration, which was used in the work of both stellar and galactic 
									astronomers. 
									</p>
									<p>I followed this work by publishing the full sample of 23 brown dwarf SEDs, 
									completing the luminosity calibration of the spectral sequence that has defined 
									stellar astronomy for over 100 years <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973..107B/abstract">(Beiler et al. 2024b)</a>. With these luminosity measurements, I lowered 
									the effective temperature uncertainties of our sample by a factor of 5, achieving an 
									average fractional uncertainty of 4% for objects down to 360 K. Since the completion 
									of this project, I applied this technique to other objects, including WISE J0855, the 
									coldest brown dwarf <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv241114541R/abstract">(Melanie et al. 2024)</a>.

									<h2 class="major">The Chemistry of Phosphine <br> and Carbon Dioxide in <br> Ultracool Atmospheres</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Website.png" alt=""/><b>I found that to fit WISE 0359-54 and other
									late T and Y dwarfs with atmospheric models, a large increase in the carbon dioxide abundance and 
									decrement in the phosphine abundance are required.</a></b></span>
									<p>
									I used Cycle 1 JWST data of cold brown dwarfs to study their atmospheric chemistry and found that the current 
									paradigm of atmospheric chemistry for phosphine and carbon dioxide was incorrect. By fitting JWST data with 
									atmospheric models that I generated, I showed the standard models under-predicted carbon dioxide 
									abundances by a factor of 200 and over-predicted phosphine abundances by a factor of 2. I also found 
									that the controversial first-ever detection of phosphine in UNCOVER-BD-3, a galactic disk brown dwarf,
									could instead be explained by this enhancement of carbon dioxide. 
									</p>
									<p>
									The carbon dioxide discrepancy is a 
									result of the quench approximation commonly used to model how the chemistry is kept out of equilibrium 
									by vertical mixing (See the figure below). I used full chemical kinetics models to show that 
									interactions between carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide which the quench approximation was ignoring 
									would cause the significant carbon dioxide enhancement needed to match observations. New models are now
									implementing this theory on carbon dioxide chemistry, resulting in improved fits to the data. 
									</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Chemical.png" alt=""/><b></a></b></span>
									<p>
									For phosphine, our knowledge of phosphorus chemical pathways is clearly incomplete, and significant 
									new chemical theory and laboratory work are underway to determine the problem. Keep an eye out for 
									future papers on modeling and observing phosphine!

									<h2 class="major">Ritter Symposium <br> and the Case for <br> Intra-Departmental <br> Conferences</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_6331.JPG" alt="" />Graduate student Colton Feathers presenting his research on cosmological 
									simulations to the rest of the UToledo Astronomy Department. </span>
									<p>
									For the last three years of my PhD I revived and organized Ritter Symposium,
									an intra-departmental conference where the various researchers at UToledo can share
									the work that they have completed over the last year. Each speaker is give ~7 minutes
									to present and answer questions, and advisors often take this time to advertise new
									project to first-year class of graduate students. The symposium has been a 
									resounding success for a number of reasons, and I believe most departments should 
									consider adopting a conference like this. The benefits include: 
									</p>
									<ol>
										<li><b>Faster On-boarding for New Students:</b><br> The conference introdces undergraduates 
										and first-year graduate students to the department's research groups, lowering the 
										activiation energy for finding an advisor and beginning research. In the three 
										years since the start of the symposiums, first year graduate students have joined 
										their research groups 3 months earlier than previous year!</li>
										<li><b>Creating Space for Collaboration:</b><br> Within a department, it is easy to lose
										touch of what everyone else is working on, and this can limit collaboration. The symposium
										helps forge connections between groups, jumpstarting new ideas and making space to share
										expertise.</li>
										<li><b>Practice Communicating Science:</b><br> For the younger students, the conference offers a
										low pressure enviorment to practice talking about the big picture of their research. For the
										older students, this lets them practice a different style and length of talk, and prepares
										them to summerize their research for job applications. </li>
